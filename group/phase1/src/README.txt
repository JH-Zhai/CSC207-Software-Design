Welcome to use our Calendar program.
To use our program, simply open the main class and run the main method.
Immediately after the program has run, you will need to use the user name and password we provided in the file 0232.txt.
The user name and password are separated by "\" respectively.
After typing in the user name and password, you should be able to see all the event that has been created.
Our program can save and load from/to file, if you enter the correct id, there will be a load-sample group_0232.txt for you.
You can also delete content in group_0232.txt, but you will lose sample.

Then you can just follow the instruction and enjoy!
